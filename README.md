# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard that visualizes key metrics related to credit card transactions and customer demographics. By leveraging SQL, Power BI, and DAX, this project aims to provide valuable insights that aid in financial analysis, customer segmentation, and strategic planning.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing credit card and customer data, originally stored in CSV files, and transforming it into a SQL database. The data is then imported into Power BI, where DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is utilized to create calculated columns and measures for deeper analysis. The final product is an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various financial metrics and customer insights.

## Project Details

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For database creation, table management, and data import.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX**: For creating calculated measures and enhancing data analysis within Power BI.

### Data Preparation:
- Imported over 20,000 rows of data into an SQL database from CSV files.
- Created two tables: `cc_detail` (credit card transactions) and `cust_detail` (customer details).

### Key Insights:

- **Revenue Analysis**:
  - Total revenue of $57M with $8M earned in interest.
  - Male customers contribute $31M, while female customers contribute $26M.
  
- **Card Performance**:
  - Blue and Silver cards dominate transactions, accounting for 93% of total transactions.
  
- **Geographic Insights**:
  - Texas, New York, and California are the top revenue-generating states, contributing 68% of overall revenue.
  
- **Other Metrics**:
  - The overall card activation rate stands at 57.5%.
  - The delinquent rate across all customers is 6.06%.

## Dashboard Features

- **Revenue Breakdown**: Visual representation of revenue by card category, gender, age group, and geographic location.
- **Transaction Analysis**: Insights into transaction volumes, customer spending habits, and interest earned.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Detailed analysis of customer demographics, including income level, education, and occupation.
- **DAX Calculations**: Advanced metrics and KPIs are calculated using DAX for more accurate and dynamic analysis.

## Benefits

- Provides a comprehensive overview of credit card performance, aiding in financial planning and risk management.
- Helps in identifying key customer segments and regions that contribute the most to revenue.
- Supports strategic decision-making through data-driven insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining SQL, Power BI, and DAX to create a powerful tool for financial analysis and decision-making. The insights derived from this dashboard can significantly impact business strategies and customer management in the credit card industry.
